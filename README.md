## About This Project

This project is created using MERN stack technology. Previously, I had used Javascript on the frontend/client. But after learning how to use Typescript with react, I have switched to Typescript. I intend to add more new features to this webapp.

I have discontinued working on Javascript version as I will be working with Typescript version from now on. If you want to check out the Javascript version then go to this link : <a href="https://github.com/alrakib1/MetaBlog-Js" target="_blank">MetaBlog Javascript version</a>

## Installation

I have used pnpm on this project. If you already have pnpm on your device just use this command after cloning this repo on both client and server folder respectively :

### For Pnpm :

```bash
  pnpm install
```

### For Npm :

#### Delete the file named Pnpm-lock.yaml and use the following command on both client and server folder:

```bash
  npm install
```
